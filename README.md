## Challenges
 - The files in the models folder, there was trouble with the appropriate syntax and so each time there was an attempt to start, it would shoot specific errors at me that took alot of time to fix one by one.
 - The routing is having some issues so routing to the appropriate places is confusing. currently says 'Wrong Route' when the application is active.
